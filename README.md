## How to Use

Download the repository from GitHub and unzip it.

Copy and paste `slave.py` in different directories on your pc.

On the repository directory, run the following command to start the `master.py`

```sh
python3 master.py
```

Open several terminal or terminal tabs and navigate to the location of the different `slave.py` and run the following command on each terminal

```sh
python3 slave.py
```

Select the port the `slave.py` will use to connect to `master.py`

You can search for a file by writing search on the terminal and then the filename (including the extension) or exit

If the filename is correct, the file will be downloaded into the `slave.py` directory
